# Shipping-Project
In this project, we will be using "if statements" to create a program that calculates the total cost of a customers shopping basket, including shipping.

- If a customer spends over $100, they get free shipping
- If a customer spends < $100, the shipping cost is $1.20 per kg of the baskets weight

Print the customers total basket cost (including shipping) to complete this exercise.
