# Shipping-Project
In this project, we will be using "if statements" to create a program that calculates the total cost of a customers shopping basket, including shipping using python.

- If a customer spends < $100, the shipping cost is $1.20 per kg of the baskets weight
- If a customer spends over $100, they get free shipping

Print the customers total basket cost (including shipping) to complete this exercise.

This pre-existing code the customer would have to pay for shipping based on the variable given.

Now for the customer to get "Free Shipping" on line 14 change the 'customer_basket_cost' variable to 101 and re-run your code. You should now get a message saying "Free Shipping!"
